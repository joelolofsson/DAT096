<msg type="info" file="PhysDesignRules" num="2288" delta="new" >The read port and write port clocks of BRAM instance, <arg fmt="%s" index="1">eth0.e1/m100.u0/edclramnft.r0/xc2v.x0/a6.x0/a9.x[0].r0</arg>, are using the same clock signal (synchronous clocking) with WRITE_FIRST mode specified. This configuration may encounter address collisions if the same address appears on both ports. It is suggested for this configuration to use READ_FIRST mode to avoid any conditions for address collision. See the FPGA Memory Resources User Guide for additional information.
