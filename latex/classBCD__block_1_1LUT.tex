Architecture of the \hyperlink{classBCD__block}{B\-C\-D\-\_\-block}.  




\subsection{Detailed Description}
Architecture of the \hyperlink{classBCD__block}{B\-C\-D\-\_\-block}. 

This component uses a lookup used in the conversion of binary to binary coded decimal. An input value above 9 is invalid and returns don't care. 

The documentation for this class was generated from the following file\-:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
\item 
\hyperlink{BCD__block_8vhd}{B\-C\-D\-\_\-block.\-vhd}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
