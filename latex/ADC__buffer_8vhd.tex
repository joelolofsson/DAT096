\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em This component buffers samples when buff\-\_\-write goes from low to high, until the buffer is full. When this happens Buffer full is driven high for one clock cycle. The softcore will the read the values from the buffer by changing the address. The buffer will then instantly output the value on this address on the buffout port. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item
