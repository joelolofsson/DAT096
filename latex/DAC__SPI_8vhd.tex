\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em The D\-A\-C S\-P\-I interface converts parallel data from the data port and transforms it to a S\-P\-I to be sent to the external D\-A\-C chip on the din port. The module also adds flag bits to this signal, aswell as a chip select signal called n\-\_\-sync. The interface listens to the sample clock and only transmits a new message when this clock goes from low to high. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item
