CRITICAL WARNING: [Timing 38-249] Generated clock CLKFBOUT has no logical paths from master clock clk.
Resolution: Review the path between the master clock and the generated clock with the schematic viewer and correct the -source option. If it is correct and the master clock does not have a timing path to the generated clock, define the generated clock as a primary clock by using create_clock.
CRITICAL WARNING: [Timing 38-249] Generated clock CLKOUT0 has no logical paths from master clock clk.
Resolution: Review the path between the master clock and the generated clock with the schematic viewer and correct the -source option. If it is correct and the master clock does not have a timing path to the generated clock, define the generated clock as a primary clock by using create_clock.
