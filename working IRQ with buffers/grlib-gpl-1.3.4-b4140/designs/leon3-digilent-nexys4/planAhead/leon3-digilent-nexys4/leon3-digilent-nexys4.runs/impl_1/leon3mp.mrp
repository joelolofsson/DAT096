  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

Section 4 - Removed Logic Summary
---------------------------------
   4 block(s) removed
   4 block(s) optimized away
   3 signal(s) removed

Section 5 - Removed Logic
-------------------------

The trimmed logic report below shows the logic removed from your design due to
sourceless or loadless signals, and VCC or ground connections.  If the removal
of a signal or symbol results in the subsequent removal of an additional signal
or symbol, the message explaining that second removal will be indented.  This
indentation will be repeated as a chain of related logic is removed.

To quickly locate the original cause for the removal of a chain of logic, look
above the place where that logic is listed in the trimming report, then locate
the lines that are least indented (begin at the leftmost edge).

Loadless block "clkgen0/xc7l.v/bufgclk90" (CKBUF) removed.
 The signal "clkgen0/xc7l.v/clk90_nobuf" is loadless and has been removed.
Loadless block "clkgen0/xc7l.v/bufgclkio" (CKBUF) removed.
 The signal "clkgen0/xc7l.v/clkio_nobuf" is loadless and has been removed.
Loadless block "ethpads.erxer_pad/xcv.x0/ttl0.ip" (BUF) removed.
 The signal "PhyRxEr" is loadless and has been removed.
  Loadless block "PhyRxEr" (PAD) removed.

Optimized Block(s):
TYPE 		BLOCK
GND 		GND
VCC 		VCC

VCC 		XST_VCC

Section 10 - Timing Report
--------------------------
A logic-level (pre-route) timing report can be generated by using Xilinx static
timing analysis tools, Timing Analyzer (GUI) or TRCE (command line), with the
mapped NCD and PCF files. Please note that this timing report will be generated
using estimated delay information. For accurate numbers, please generate a
timing report with the post Place and Route NCD file.

For more information about the Timing Analyzer, consult the Xilinx Timing
Analyzer Reference Manual; for more information about TRCE, consult the Xilinx
Command Line Tools User Guide "TRACE" chapter.
