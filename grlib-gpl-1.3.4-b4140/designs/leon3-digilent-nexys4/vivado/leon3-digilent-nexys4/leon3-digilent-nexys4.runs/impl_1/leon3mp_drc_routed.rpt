2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
REQP-1578#1 Error
Required Pin  
Unsupported must be driven by a clock capable IO. connectivity. The signal io0/inst_top/inst_DMC/inst/clk_in1 on the io0/inst_top/inst_DMC/inst/mmcm_adv_inst/CLKIN1 pin of io0/inst_top/inst_DMC/inst/mmcm_adv_inst with COMPENSATION mode MMCME2_ADV ZHOLD
Related violations: <none>

AVAL-39#1 Warning
V7_MMCM_SET_COMPENSATION4  
Cell io0/inst_top/inst_DMC/inst/mmcm_adv_inst of type 'MMCME2_ADV' has been detected to have a configuration that requires the COMPENSATION setting to be different than ZHOLD. The application, in most cases, can automatically set the COMPENSATION attribute provided that the original COMPENSATION attribute is left with its default value by the designer. If the COMPENSATION remains as default it means that the application could not set the COMPENSATION but the design still has errors.

CFGBVS-1#1 Warning
Missing CFGBVS and CONFIG_VOLTAGE Design Properties  
Neither the CFGBVS nor CONFIG_VOLTAGE voltage property is set in the current_design.  Configuration bank voltage select (CFGBVS) must be set to VCCO or GND, and CONFIG_VOLTAGE must be set to the correct configuration voltage, in order to determine the I/O voltage support for the pins in bank 0.  It is suggested to specify these either using the 'Edit Device Properties' function in the GUI or directly in the XDC file using the following syntax:

 set_property CFGBVS value1 [current_design]
 #where value1 is either VCCO or GND

 set_property CONFIG_VOLTAGE value2 [current_design]
 #where value2 is the voltage provided to configuration bank 0

Refer to the device configuration user guide for more information.
