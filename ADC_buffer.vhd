--! This component buffers samples when buff_write goes from low to high, until the buffer is full. When this happens Buffer full is driven high for one clock cycle. The softcore will the read the values from the buffer by changing the address. The buffer will then instantly output the value on this address on the buffout port.

--! @brief Architecture of the ADC buffer
--! @details The architecture containing the main body of the component.
architecture Buffer_ADC of ADC_buffer is

type Memory_array_type is array (0 to 2**bufferwidth-1) of STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(15 downto 0);	--! The memory storage type. The type creates an array of a size of 2^bufferwidth*16.

signal Memory_array : Memory_array_type;							--! The actual memory storage element. This signal holds all of the stored elements.

signal lastwrite: STD_LOGIC;									--! Lastwrite holds the last value of buff_write to be able to detect a rising edge without using the signal as a clock.

signal Write_index : integer range 0 to 2**bufferwidth-1;					--! Write_index is a signal to indicate where the next value in the buffer is to be written. When this happens the write_index is incremented by one. This makes the buffer write in a circular fashion.

begin


process(clk,rst)								--! The main process of the module. In this process handles the writing to the buffer. This process is Dependant on the clock and the reset
begin
	if rst = '0' then							
		Write_index <= 0;						--! Write_index is reseted to start at 0
		Memory_array <= (others => (others => '0'));			--! The buffer memory_array is emptied
		Bufferfull <= '0';						--! the bufferfull is set to '0'
		last_write <= '0';						--! last_write is set to '0'
	elsif rising_edge(clk) then
            bufferfull <= '0';							--! Buffer full is set to 0 to avoid a '1' being stored. If a 1 were stored the interrupt will be high for more than 1 clock cycle, this violates the rules of the Leon3.
		if (buff_write = '1') and (lastwrite = '0') then		--! When lastwrite goes from '0' to '1':
			Memory_array(write_index) <= buffin;			--! Store the current buffin at the address specified by the write_index
			if write_index = 2**bufferwidth -1 then			--! If the buffer is full
				write_index <= 0;				--! Reset the write_index
				Bufferfull <= '1';				--! Send the interrupt to the processor
			else
				Write_index <= write_index + 1 ;		--! Otherwise the write_index is incremented by 1.
			end if;
		end if;
	end if;

	lastwrite <= buff_write;						--! last write is updated.
end process;

buffout <= Memory_array(to_integer(unsigned(addr)));				--! This line outputs the value of the buffer of the current address to the out port.
